# Alfred Workflow for creating fake data

This uses the [faker gem](https://github.com/stympy/faker). Some of the methods might have required arguments and might not work but a large chunch of them seam to work. I think the faker gem community has updated the gem to make it not have required arguments but you never know. If there is a problem just place it in the Issues area and I will try to get around to fixing it. That or just download the workflow and make any changes you think you would want to see.
